# -Predicting-Wine-Quality-with-Linear-Regression
Used Multiple Linear Regression which will predict the quality of wine using 11 features. The dataset was taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.There are 4898 samples of white wine in the dataset.
OBJECTIVE
Import the modules and dependencies and load the dataset.
Clean the data, fill the null values with imputation if any.
Perform EDA on the dataset.
Label is quality, do the target analysis with features.
Check for correlations among features, also use heatmaps.
Do Features engineering.
Slice the dataset into features and label.
Split the data into training and testing dataset.
Drop those features that are having high correlation among other features that are exceeding a threshold value.
Features selection based on correlations.
Apply features scaling on both training and testing features.
Apply Regression techniques and compare the models.
With applying correlations to select non-redundant features

# - CONCLUSION
Predictive Power: If you have used linear regression to build a predictive model, the coefficient values for the independent variables can provide insights into which factors are most influential in predicting the dependent variable. Understanding these relationships can be valuable for making future predictions.

Causality vs. Correlation: Linear regression can show associations between variables, but it doesn't prove causality. It's crucial to be cautious when interpreting results. Just because two variables are correlated doesn't mean one causes the other. Further research and experimentation may be needed to establish causation.

Model Fit: The goodness-of-fit statistics, such as R-squared, provide information about how well the linear regression model fits the data. A higher R-squared value indicates a better fit, but it's essential to remember that even a high R-squared doesn't guarantee that the model is perfect.

Residual Analysis: Examining the residuals (the differences between observed and predicted values) can reveal patterns or outliers in the data. If there are systematic patterns in the residuals, it may indicate that the linear model is not capturing all relevant relationships. Addressing these issues may lead to model improvements.

Variable Significance: Assess the statistical significance of each predictor variable. Variables with low significance may not be contributing meaningfully to the model and could potentially be removed to simplify the model.

Practical Significance: While a variable may be statistically significant, it's essential to consider whether the magnitude of the effect is practically meaningful. In some cases, even small effects may have substantial real-world implications, while in others, large effects may not matter much in practice.

Outliers and Anomalies: Investigate any outliers or unusual data points that might be affecting the results. Understanding the reasons behind these outliers can provide insights into the data collection process or uncover interesting phenomena in the real world.

Assumptions Validation: Linear regression assumes certain conditions, such as linearity, normality of residuals, and constant variance. Assess whether these assumptions hold in your real-world context. Violations of these assumptions could impact the validity of your findings.

Decision-Making: If the linear regression analysis is part of a decision-making process, consider how the results will inform those decisions. Will the findings lead to policy changes, resource allocation, or other actions?

Future Research: Linear regression can be a starting point for more in-depth investigations. It can generate hypotheses or identify areas where further research is needed to gain a deeper understanding of the problem.
